"""Distributed_compy

Distributed_compy is a powerful distributed computing library that harnesses the processing power of a cluster through multi-threading, heterogeneous (CPU + multiple GPUs), and multi-node (hybrid cluster) paradigms. It utilizes Cython to generate glue code for its core C/C++ functions and provides wrappers for seamless Python integration. The library requires numpy, CUDA toolkit>=2.0, OpenMP, and OpenMPI (Note: it does not use the mpi4py library).

Key Features:

- **Bandwidth Management:** Efficiently manage and configure bandwidths for both the local node and the entire cluster.

- **Flexible Code Generation:** Generate temporary binary data files or Python files tailored for execution on each node within the cluster.

- **MPI Command Execution:** Execute the mpirun command from the master node using default environment variables or a configurable hostfile.

- **Versatile Reduction Operations:** Perform reduction sum operations with a range of optimization levels, including Python naive sum, multi-threaded reduction sum, multi-GPU reduction sum, heterogeneous reduction sum, and hybrid heterogeneous reduction sum.

- **Future Enhancements:** Continuous development efforts are focused on expanding the library's capabilities to include additional reduction operations, dot product, matrix multiplication, image processing kernels, neural networks, and finite element method functions.

**Function Documentation:**

**find_in_path(name, path)**

Searches the specified path for a file with the given name.

**Parameters:**

- `name`: The name of the file to search for.

- `path`: The path to search within.

**Returns:**

- The absolute path to the file if found, or None if not found.

**locate_cuda()**

Locates the CUDA environment on the system and returns a dictionary containing paths to the CUDA home directory, nvcc compiler, include directory, and library directory.

**Returns:**

- A dictionary containing the paths to the CUDA environment components.

**locate_mpi()**

Locates the MPI environment on the system and returns a dictionary containing the path to the OpenMPI include directory.

**Returns:**

- A dictionary containing the path to the OpenMPI include directory.

**CustomBuildExt Class:**

This custom build_ext class enables CUDA compilation by setting the appropriate compiler flags and environment variables.

**main() Function:**

The main entry point for the script. Handles the initialization and setup of the distributed_compy library.

**Overall, the distributed_compy library provides a comprehensive set of tools for harnessing the power of distributed computing across various hardware configurations. Its comprehensive documentation and well-structured code make it accessible to developers of all levels.**
